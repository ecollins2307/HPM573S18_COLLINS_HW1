#HW 1, Problem 1

#Part 1

#creating y1 as integer
y1 = int(17)
#creating y2 as float
y2 = float(17)
#creating y3 as string
y3 = "17"
#creating y4 as Boolean
y4 = (17==17)
#printing the above variable with their type
print(y1)
print(type(y1))
print(y2)
print(type(y2))
print(y3)
print(type(y3))
print(y4)
print(type(y4))

#Part 2

#create text variable using y3
text = "The value of x is "+y3
print(text)
